# Navigation Dashboard

This project aims at management of stationery items by users based on their roles in database.

MVC Framework: CakePHP
Database: PostgreSQL
Theme: AdminLTE 2
Styling: Bootstrap
ORM: Built-in ORM of CakePHP

## CakePHP Usage  
### Running the server

You can either use your machine's webserver to view the default home page, or start up the built-in webserver with:

```bash
bin/cake server -p 8765
```
Then visit `http://localhost:8765` to see the welcome page.

### Configuration

Read and edit `config/app.php` and setup the `'Datasources'` and any other
configuration relevant for your application.
I have used PostgreSQL in this project and same has been updated in the corresponding field.
